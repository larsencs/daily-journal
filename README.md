# Daily Journal

### About the project
The assignment is to create a daily journal application, first as a minimal viable product (basically just a form) and then conforming to a wireframe designed by the student. In it's current form, it's not much more than the wireframe blocked out in html elements -- but in time I plan to add a ton more styling and functionality.

### Difficulties and challenges
I came into this bootcamp with a fair bit of previous coding experience, so javascript itself doesn't really give me huge issues (yet) -- but man do I struggle with css. Each time I feel I have the hang of it, I run into an entirely new issue. For instance, I've tackled the hurdles of organizing items with flexbox (I think), so I laid my wireframe out with boxes I knew I could organize. Should be pretty easy to just whip that out and move on, right? Nope. It took forever (or at least felt like it) to figure out how to make my textarea as large as I designed it to be on the wireframe, and in a way that was responsive.
